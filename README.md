## Description

This repository contains the code, implementation details, and experimental results for my MSc thesis at Oxford. Specifically, the project develops a nested mixed-precision Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) framework using reduced-precision for financial derivative pricing (solving the Geometric Brownian Motion SDE).
